## FIXME: Dunno what is returned here in real. This output was grabbed form my Condor.
#         Interesting value here is 'cluster 1', but dunno if it's instance ID
#         For testing now I replaced:
#
#         Submitting job(s).
#         1 job(s) submitted to cluster 1.
#
#         with:
#
#         Submitting job(s).
#         1 job(s) submitted to cluster kvm_test2.
#

cat <<EOF
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster kvm_test2.
