Condor Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document explains how to go about setting up the condor cloud.
The condor cloud uses the deltacloud driver as the API to implement a
private cloud system.

Requirements:
- One x86_64 machine to run as the master condor server.  This server will
  have the condor-cloud rpm on it.
- Zero or more (the master can run VMs) x86_64 machines to use as nodes to run
  cloud instances on.  These machines will each have the condor-cloud-node rpm
  installed and be configured to talk to the master.


Networking
~~~~~~~~~~

Since the cloud is a network based system, you will want to enable bridging
on each system you want to run instances on.  This will allow your VMs to
directly talk on the network and be reachable via ssh etc.  This step must be
done on both the master and nodes.


You will have to configure your ethernet device.  Create a file
corresponding to your main network interface.  This would typically be
'eth0' but depends on the configuration of the hardware etc.  For eth0
we would create the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-eth0.  
It should look like:

DEVICE=eth0
# change the hardware address to match the hardware address your NIC uses
HWADDR=00:16:76:D6:C9:45
ONBOOT=yes
BRIDGE=br0

Now we want to create a bridge.  Create the file: 
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br0:

DEVICE=br0
TYPE=Bridge
BOOTPROTO=dhcp
ONBOOT=yes
DELAY=0

Note that if you use a bridge name other than br0 you will have to edit
the configuration in deltacloud (more on that below).

Disable NetworkManager and start regular network service:

# chkconfig NetworkManager off
# chkconfig network on
# service NetworkManager stop
# service network start

Configure iptables to allow all traffic to be forwarded across the bridge.

# iptables -I FORWARD -m physdev --physdev-is-bridged -j ACCEPT
# service iptables save
# service iptables restart

Restart libvirt:

# service libvirtd reload


Condor Cloud Master Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First step is to install condor-cloud rpm (which you probably
already have).  This will install condor, libvirt, kvm and
deltacloud core.  It also installs a sample configuration as
/etc/condor/config.d/50condor_cloud.config and the supporting scripts
for condor to operate as a cloud.

Configure condor to start on boot and start it now:

# chkconfig condor on
# service condor start

Configure deltacloud core to start on bootup with the condor backend driver in
place:



The first step is to get the right version of condor.  At this time
this is the upstream 7.6 version, which is also available in the Aeolus
testing repo.  To install the repo use one of these:

http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/aeolus/packages-testing/fedora-aeolus-testing.repo
http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/aeolus/packages-testing/rhel-aeolus-testing.repo

and put it in /etc/yum.repos.d/

Then simply:

  sudo yum install condor-vm-gahp

Copy the condor_config.local to /var/lib/condor/condor_config.local:

  sudo cp config/condor_config.local /var/lib/condor/condor_config.local

Copy the support scripts to /usr/libexec/condor:

  sudo cp bash/* /usr/libexec/condor/

Restart the condor service to pick up the new config:

  sudo service condor restart

Condor is now started and is ready to be used by the deltacloud API.  One thing left 
is to create the directory structure for images.  This is done with:

sudo mkdir /home/cloud/
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/images
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/images/staging
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/cache

I personally chown'd those all to my user account so that I could access them freely.
In the future this will be its own account (and you could certainly just adduser cloud
if you felt like it), but for now this will work.

You must also get a valid image or 3 into /home/cloud/images.  This should be a plain
KVM formatted image.

Condor Cloud Deltacloud API driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements:

* Condor installed using steps from 'Condor Cloud' section above
* Commands in shell path: condor_q, condor_submit and condor_rm
* VM images in /home/cloud/images directory

Installation:

1. git clone git://git.apache.org/deltacloud.git core
2. Copy deltacloud-condor-driver/* into core/server/lib/deltacloud/drivers/condor
3. Edit core/server/config/drivers.yaml and add following lines to enable Condor driver:

:condor:
  :name: Condor

4. Copy config/addresses.xml into core/server/config/
5. Start Deltacloud API using: ./bin/deltacloudd -i condor

Alternative installation (RPM)

1. wget http://mifo.sk/fedora/condor/deltacloud-condor-0.3.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
2. rpm -i deltacloud-condor-0.3.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
3. Edit /etc/sysconfig/deltacloud-condor and write an HOST or IP address and PORT here:

/etc/sysconfig/deltacloud-condor:
HOST=10.0.0.1
PORT=3005

4. Restart deltacloud-condor server using 'service deltacloud-condor restart'


Testing && Developing:

Test::Unit files are located in 'test' directory, but to execute them you need to do
some modifications in executor.rb. First you need to change a path for base_model, because
it's set to Deltacloud API default dir.
Then you can execute test suite using: 'rake test'

Using:

You can now navigate to localhost:3001 (default) and if you have an image in
/home/cloud/images you will be able to launch that image.
