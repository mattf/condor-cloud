Condor Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This document explains how to go about setting up the condor cloud.
The condor cloud uses the deltacloud driver as the API to implement a private cloud system.

The first step is to get the right version of condor.  At this time
this is the upstream 7.6 version, which is also available in the Aeolus
testing repo.  To install the repo use one of these:

http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/aeolus/packages-testing/fedora-aeolus-testing.repo
http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/aeolus/packages-testing/rhel-aeolus-testing.repo

and put it in /etc/yum.repos.d/

Then simply:

  sudo yum install condor-vm-gahp

Copy the condor_config.local to /var/lib/condor/condor_config.local:

  sudo cp config/condor_config.local /var/lib/condor/condor_config.local

Copy the support scripts to /usr/libexec/condor:

  sudo cp bash/* /usr/libexec/condor/

Restart the condor service to pick up the new config:

  sudo service condor restart

Condor is now started and is ready to be used by the deltacloud API.  One thing left 
is to create the directory structure for images.  This is done with:

sudo mkdir /home/cloud/
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/images
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/images/staging
sudo mkdir /home/cloud/cache

I personally chown'd those all to my user account so that I could access them freely.
In the future this will be its own account (and you could certainly just adduser cloud
if you felt like it), but for now this will work.

You must also get a valid image or 3 into /home/cloud/images.  This should be a plain
KVM formatted image.

Condor Cloud Deltacloud API driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements:

* Condor installed using steps from 'Condor Cloud' section above
* Commands in shell path: condor_q, condor_submit and condor_rm
* VM images in /home/cloud/images directory

Installation:

1. git clone git://git.apache.org/deltacloud.git core
2. Copy deltacloud-condor-driver/* into core/server/lib/deltacloud/drivers/condor
3. Edit core/server/config/drivers.yaml and add following lines to enable Condor driver:

:condor:
  :name: Condor

4. Copy config/addresses.xml into core/server/config/
5. Start Deltacloud API using: ./bin/deltacloudd -i condor

Alternative installation (RPM)

1. wget http://mifo.sk/fedora/condor/deltacloud-condor-0.3.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
2. rpm -i deltacloud-condor-0.3.0-2.el6.noarch.rpm
3. Edit /etc/sysconfig/deltacloud-condor and write an HOST or IP address and PORT here:

/etc/sysconfig/deltacloud-condor:
HOST=10.0.0.1
PORT=3005

4. Restart deltacloud-condor server using 'service deltacloud-condor restart'


Testing && Developing:

Test::Unit files are located in 'test' directory, but to execute them you need to do
some modifications in executor.rb. First you need to change a path for base_model, because
it's set to Deltacloud API default dir.
Then you can execute test suite using: 'rake test'

Using:

You can now navigate to localhost:3001 (default) and if you have an image in
/home/cloud/images you will be able to launch that image.
